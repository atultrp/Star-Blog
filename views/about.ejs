                    Hey there, this fantastic website made by <strong>Atul Tripathi</strong> and <strong>Ghanshyam
                        Verma</strong> from India.
                    Our passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant
                    interfaces. We take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things we
                    build.
                    <br />
                    We're also an <strong>open-source</strong> enthusiast and maintainer. We learned a lot from the
                    open-source community and we love how <strong>collaboration and knowledge sharing</strong> happened
                    through open-source.
